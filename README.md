### Hello, Cargo ðŸ‘‹

-
:beginner: I am a novice-level programmer who is interested in anything that shines.
:gear: I am a CS/CE Student in Ankara University.
:crab: I chose Rust as my primary language, and I have an intermediate knowledge about Python, C, JavaScript and GDScript.
:teapot: I have an intermediate understanding of pure HTML and pure CSS. Perhaps one day I'll figure out how to combine JS with those two.
:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Git feels like witchcraft and I'm all for it.
:fountain: Linux, Atom(rip) and Godot. FOSS all the way.
